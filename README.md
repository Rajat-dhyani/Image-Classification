# Image Net Bot
*Udacity - Machine learning Nano Degree Program : Project-5*

## Project Overview
*This is fifth project in the series of the projects listed in Udacity- Machine Learning Nano Degree Program.*

In this project, I have classified images from the [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html). The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. The dataset was first preprocessed, then trained a convolutional neural network on all the samples. I have normalized the images, one-hot encoded the labels, build a convolutional layer, max pool layer, and fully connected layer.

## Project Highlights
*In this project i have applied deep learning techniques to train a model to classify images using convolutional neural network algorithm. I have also learnt how to apply my knowledge of neural networks on real datasets using [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), an open source Deep Learning library created by Google.*

**Achievements:**
* Built an image classification bot using convolutional neural networks to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.
* Achieved accuracy of 60.42 %.

Things i have learnt by completing this project:
* How to apply deep learning techniques: Convolutional Neural Network algorithms.
* How to use tensorflow library.
* How to preprocess given data.
* How to analyze model's performance.
* How to optimise Convolutional Neural Network algortithm, to ensure increase in postive results.
